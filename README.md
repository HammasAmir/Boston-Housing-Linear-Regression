# 🏡 Boston Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project uses the Boston Housing dataset to predict **median house prices (MEDV)** based on features like number of rooms,
% lower status population, and more. It's a beginner-friendly demonstration of simple linear regression using Python and scikit-learn.
